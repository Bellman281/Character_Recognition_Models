1. EMNIST DATASET Benchmark >>> Chracter Recognition Model
   Data set is 'balanced' EMNIST.
  
   train size: 90240, val size: 22560 , test size: 18800 
  
 Model:  [SOINALnet] (https://github.com/dipuk0506/SpinalNet/blob/master/MNIST/default_pytorch_EMNIST.py)
   
   (k80 GPU, each epoch 20 sec.)
   
   Test accuracy : 84.5 after 30 epoch training. 
   
   Test accuracy : 85.82 after 100 epoch training. The model file is uploaded here. 117kb size. Model size is insane!
